# TokenStaker---Decentralized-Token-Staking-Platform
TokenStaker is a full-stack decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to stake their tokens (StakeToken) and earn rewards (RewardToken) over time. This project demonstrates a secure and transparent staking mechanism, providing incentives for token holders to participate in the network.
